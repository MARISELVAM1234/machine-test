## Logout Functionality

The Figma design provided for this project does **not** include a logout button or any logout-related user interface.  
As a result, logout functionality is not implemented in this application.

If logout is required in the future, it can be added by clearing the user's authentication data from `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, and redirecting the user to the login page.
